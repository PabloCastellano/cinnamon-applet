Work in progress Cinnamon applet for hamster.

h1. Installing

To install just symlink checkout folder into @~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/@
as hamster@projecthamster.wordpress.com.
It looks something like this:

pre. cd ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/
ln -s /path/to/the/checkout hamster@projecthamster.wordpress.com

h1. Known issues

* Still very much a fork of the gnome shell extension - so not fully "Cinnamon-ized" yet
* Settings currently hard-coded (work in progress)
* Translations/Locales currently not working
